/*Problem Statement:
    Given the volume and perimeter of the triangular base of the prism, and the circumference of the
    inner circle. Calculate the height of the prism.
Example:

Input 
    radius=3, perimeter=15, Volume=270

Output 
    12

Explanation:

    The radius of the triangle is given as ` area / semi perimeter `. And the semi perimeter of the triangle is
    half the triangle perimeter. Substituting the values we can get the area of the triangle i.e.


    area = Inradius * semi perimeter
        = 3  *  15  /  2


    Comparing it with volume of prism i.e. area * h we can get the height as

            270 = h * ( 3 * 15 / 2 )
              h = 12

*/


function height_of_prism(perimeter, radius, volume){
    let semi_perimeter = perimeter / 2;
    let area = radius * semi_perimeter;
    let height = volume / area;

    console.log(height);
}

height_of_prism(3, 15, 270);
