// numbers are in this range

// "Problem Statement 2:
//
// Vasya likes the number 2, 3, 9. Therefore, he considers a number pretty if its last digit is 2, 3 or 9.
// Vasya wants to watch the numbers between L and R(both inclusive), so he asked you to determine how many pretty numbers are in this range.Can you help him ?

//     Input
// The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.The description of T test cases follows.
// The first and only line of each test case contains two space - separated integers L and R.

//     Output
// For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of pretty numbers between L and R.

//     Constraints
// 1≤T≤100
// 1≤L≤R≤105

// Subtasks
// Subtask #1(100 points): original constraints
// Sample Input 1
// 2
// 1 10
// 11 33
// Sample Output 1
// 3
// 8
// Explanation
// Example case 1: The pretty numbers between 1 and 10 are 2, 3 and 9.
// Example case 2: The pretty numbers between 11 and 33 are 12, 13, 19, 22, 23, 29, 32 and 33."
