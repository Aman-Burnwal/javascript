// Purchase the bike or not
// Problem Statement 1:

// Chef opened a company which manufactures cars and bikes.Each car requires 4 tyres while each bike requires 2 tyres.Chef has a total of N tyres(N is even).He wants to manufacture maximum number of cars from these tyres and then manufacture bikes from the remaining tyres.
//     Chef's friend went to Chef to purchase a bike. If Chef's company has manufactured even a single bike then Chef's friend will be able to purchase it.
// Determine whether he will be able to purchase the bike or not.
// Input Format
// The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.The T test cases then follow.
// The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of tyres.
 
// Output Format
// For each test case, output YES or NO depending on whether Chef's friend will be able to purchase the bike or not. Output is case insensitive.
// Constraints
// 1≤T≤100
// 2≤N≤1000
// N is even
 
 
// Sample Input 1
// 3
// 8
// 2
// 6
// Sample Output 1
// NO
// YES
// YES
// Explanation
// For the first test case Chef, will manufacture 2 cars and will thus use all the 8 tyres and thus could not manufacture any bike.
// For the second test case, Chef cannot manufacture any car since there are not enough tyres and will thus manufacture only a single bike which will be purchased by Chef's friend.
// For the third test case, Chef will manufacture 1 car and thus use 4 tyres.From the remaining 2 tyres, Chef can manufacture a single bike which will be purchased by Chef's friend.
