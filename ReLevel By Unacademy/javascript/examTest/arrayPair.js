// Not Equal Pairs
// Question Name: Not Equal pairs



// Problem Statement

// Antonio got an array A for his christmas present. Array A consists of N positive integers.
// He wants to give a pair of integers from this array to his girlfriend Teena.
// Teena likes a pair of integers (a,b) if and only they both are unequal i.e a != b holds.
// Now Antonio wants to find the number of pairs he can gift to Teena such that she likes it. 
// Note that an element of the array can be a part of atmost one pair.
// As Antonio is weak in arrays he asked you for help. Help Him !


// Input Format
// First line contains a single integer denoting N.
// Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of array A.

// Output Format
// Print the number of pairs Antonio can gift to Teena such that she likes it.


// Constraints
// 1<=N<=105
// 1<=Ai<=109

// Sample Input 1
// 5
// 2 1 3 2 1

// Sample Output 1
// 2

// Explanation of Sample 1
// Antonio can form the pairs as : (1st element, 3rd element), (4th element, 5th element)

const pair = (arr, len) => {
    i = 0;
    sum = 0;
    while(i < len - 1) {
        if(arr[i] != arr[i + 1]){
            sum += 1;
            i+= 2;
        } else {
            i++;
        }
        
    }
    return sum;
}

console.log(pair([1,2,3,4,5], 5));
