/**
 * • Let me explain you one more example with setTimeout function,
 
     • In 1st for loop the output should be 4 for every 
 * execution, why because javascript won’t wait for the 
 * setTimeout to be executed so the loop will execute and
 * move the settimeout function into execution and loop
 * stopped at the end ‘i’ vaue is 4 and in the var keyword
 * every ‘i’ in the log is pointing to the same memory
 * location so the value is logging as 4
 
    • In 2nd for loop the let keyword will allow to make a copy
 * of value and pass into the settimeout function, so every
 * execution in for loop has a copy of ‘i’ so it is logging the
 * expected output 0, 1, 2, 3
 *

//loop 1

for(var i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log(i)
    }, i * 2000);
}


// loop 2

// uncomment it and comment loop1
// for(let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
//     setTimeout(() => {
//         console.log(i)
//     }, i * 1000);
